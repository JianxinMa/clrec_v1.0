Please read [multclr_v2](../multclr_v2), the refactored version, instead.

multclr_v1 is the version of multi-interest CLRec that we have deployed online sometime in 2020. The code is messy and
hard to understand.

Update: code of multclr_v1 is removed because it is too hard to understand, and I don't want to receive emails that ask
me to explain it :(
